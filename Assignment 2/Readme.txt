Currency Converter using Python and Tkinter
This is a simple currency converter application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows the user to select two different currencies and enter an amount in the first currency, which is then converted to the second currency based on the latest exchange rate fetched from the Open Exchange Rates API.

Dependencies
The application uses the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Tkinter (Python GUI library)
Requests (Python library for making HTTP requests)
ttk (Python module for creating themed widgets in Tkinter)
Usage
To use the application, simply run the currency_converter.py file. This will open the application window, which allows the user to select two currencies, enter an amount, and convert the amount to the second currency.

Step-by-Step Instructions
Select the first currency from the dropdown menu labeled "Select Currency".
Enter the amount you want to convert in the "Enter Amount" field.
Click the "Convert" button to convert the amount to the second currency.
The converted amount will be displayed in the "Converted Currency" field.
To reset the amount, click the "Reset" button.
How it works
When the user clicks the "Convert" button, the convert() function is called. This function fetches the latest exchange rate data from the Open Exchange Rates API and extracts the exchange rates for the two currencies selected by the user.

The amount entered by the user is then converted from the first currency to the second currency using the exchange rates fetched from the API. The converted amount is displayed in the "Converted Currency" field.
